# Simple Open Social Server
This project contains a simple and incomplete implementation of the Open Social API. It can be used to mock or imitate a 'real' Open Social Server.

It is written in Scala using [scalatra](http://www.scalatra.org/) and [lift-json](https://github.com/lift/lift/tree/master/framework/lift-base/lift-json/).

## Running the server
You should have [sbt](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki) installed.  
Type in your terminal `sbt` and after sbt has started `container:start`.  
The SOS Server should be running now on localist:8081
